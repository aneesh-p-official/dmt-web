# 🎓 DeMont – Selected Program Page (Frontend UI/UX Task)

This project is a submission for the Frontend Developer (UI/UX) role at **Westford**.  
The goal was to recreate the "Selected Program" page from the **DeMont** website based on a Figma prototype, and build a responsive, interactive, and pixel-perfect UI.

## 🔍 What I Focused On

- Pixel-perfect desktop layout matching the Figma prototype
- Recreating hover states, animations, and transitions exactly as per design
- Building a clean and scalable folder structure
- Ensuring accessibility and semantic HTML
- Maintaining UI/UX consistency across screen sizes

## 📱 Responsive Design

Since the Figma file only included a desktop view, I created the mobile version using best UX practices:

- Used Tailwind's responsive utilities to manage layout shifts
- Converted grid-based sections to horizontal carousels on mobile
- Ensured tap-friendly buttons and readable font sizes
- Carefully handled image aspect ratios and stack order for visual consistency

## Assumptions & Challenges

- Some interactions/animations weren’t fully clear in the prototype; I filled in using common UX standards
- No mobile version provided, so I designed a mobile-first layout based on the desktop structure
- Implemented basic AOS animations similar to what was visible in Figma
- Assumed that responsiveness and interactivity take precedence over framework constraints
